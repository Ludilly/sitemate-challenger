# Sitemate challenger

This repository is about Sitemate challanger

This project was created by me, Luiza Carvalho Dilly D'Angelo as a challenger to Sitemate.
The objective of this application is create a Dialog/Modal component wihtout libs or framework, using only vanilla Js.

## Video

heres the link for recording video https://www.loom.com/share/86e80c76180a4fac91ef9afa11be8fa7, giving a quick explanation about this component works.


## How to access the application?

Clone this repository and use Live Share extension from VSCode to visualize the application

## What would I do better?

I'd made the text button dinamic by creating a new parameters at button component, like "buttonTitle1" and "buttonTitle2", and at innerHtml.
When I call button component I'd just put it the title parameters and it would work.
